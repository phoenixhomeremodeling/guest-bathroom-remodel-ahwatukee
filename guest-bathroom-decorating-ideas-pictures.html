<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>In 2023, it&#39;s improbable that renovation costs will experience significant decreases, though specific prices are challenging to forecast; however, this doesn&#39;t preclude the possibility of investing in immediate repairs or smaller remodeling endeavors.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">

<div class="card-body"><p>For instance, when considering a do-it-yourself project for a 5 x 8 foot bathroom (40 square feet) at an estimated cost of $100 per square foot, factoring in a 30-percent overage allowance would result in a practical budget of $5,200.</p>
